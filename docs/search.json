The working directory is the folder on your computer where R looks for files (e.g., data) to load and saves files you create. While there are different ways to set your working directory, this lesson will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of two common methods: using setwd() and RStudio Projects.\n\n\n5.1.2 What is setwd()?\nThe setwd() function in R sets the working directory to a specific folder.

Alternatively, you can use Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory in RStudio.\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/MyProject\")\nBenefits of setwd()\n\nQuick setup: Useful for ad hoc or one-time analyses.\nSimple to understand: Easy to use for beginners doing small, standalone projects.\n\nDrawbacks of setwd()\n\nNot portable: If you share your code with someone else, it may not work because their folder paths are different.\nError-prone: Forgetting to set the correct working directory can cause errors when loading or saving files.\nBad practice for larger projects: As projects grow, managing file paths with setwd() becomes cumbersome and difficult to maintain.\n\n\n\n5.1.3 What Are RStudio Projects?\nRStudio Projects provide a structured way to manage your working directory. When you create a Project in RStudio, a special file (.Rproj) is created. Opening this file automatically sets the working directory to the folder containing the Project. You can create a Project in RStudio by following these steps:\n\nGo to File &gt; New Project\nChoose a new or existing directory\nThis creates an .Rproj file and sets the working directory automatically\n\nFurther information on how to set up Projects in RStudio can be found in the RStudio Projects Guide.\nBenefits of RStudio Projects\n\nPortability: Code and file references work seamlessly on any computer without modification.\nOrganization: Keeps all related files (data, scripts, output) in one folder.\nBest practice: Encourages better habits for managing larger or collaborative projects.\nIntegration: Works well with version control systems like Git, making collaboration easier.\n\nDrawbacks of RStudio Projects\n\nLearning curve: May feel complex for students doing very small, simple tasks.\nOverhead for small tasks: Setting up a Project for quick analyses might seem unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor most work—-especially as your projects grow in size or complexity—-we recommend using RStudio Projects.

Projects are strongly recommended for better organization and reproducibility, but setting a working directory is an alternative if needed (see also the respective section in 0. Getting Started).\nThe best way to organize your work is to create an RStudio project. This keeps all related files in a single folder. Follow these steps:\n\nOpen RStudio.\nGo to File &gt; New Project.\nSelect New Directory and then New Project.\nChoose a location on your computer and give the project a name, e.g., ResearchMethodsLab. Avoid spaces in folder and file names.\nClick Create Project. RStudio will open a new session within the project folder.\nCreate a new R script: Go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nSave the script in your project folder with an appropriate name, e.g., Lab_Exercise_A.R.\n\nIf you are not using a project, you will need to set a working directory manually. The working directory is the folder where R looks for files and saves outputs.\n\nIn your Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows), create a new folder for the R Labs (e.g., ResearchMethodsLab). Avoid spaces in folder and file names.\nOpen RStudio.\nCreate a new R script: Go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nSave the script in the folder that you previously created with an appropriate name, e.g., Lab_Exercise_A.R.\nSet the working directory in your script using the setwd() function.

    "text": "7.1 Vectors\nVectors are one of the most fundamental data structures in R, designed to store a sequence of elements of the same type (e.g., numeric, character, logical). They are extensively used in R for data manipulation, analysis, and computations due to their simplicity and efficiency. A vector can be created using the c() function, which combines individual elements into a single structure. For example, c(1, 2, 3) creates a numeric vector containing three elements. R performs operations on vectors element-wise, making it easy to perform tasks such as arithmetic, logical comparisons, and indexing. Vectors serve as building blocks for more complex data structures like matrices, lists, and data frames, making them indispensable in R programming for both basic and advanced applications.\n# Numeric vector\nprices &lt;- c(100.5, 200.75, 300.25)   # c() is used to create both numeric and character vectors\n\n# Character vector\nproducts &lt;- c(\"Laptop\", \"Tablet\", \"Smartphone\")\n\n# Logical vector\navailable &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n\n# Mixed vectors\nmixed &lt;- c(\"g\",1,3,\"m\")\n\n# Checking the type of a vector\ntypeof(prices)  # Output: \"double\"\ntypeof(mixed)  # Output: \"character\", if there are a mixture of strings and numbers the numbers will be forced to be characters\nWe can easily create vectors with repeating sequences of elements:\nseq_vector1 &lt;- seq(1,4, by=0.5)        # creates a vector going from 1 to 4 in steps of 0.5\nseq_vector2 &lt;- seq(1,4, length.out=10) # creates a vector of evenly spaced numbers from 1 to 4 with lenth 10\nseq_vector3 &lt;- 1:4                     # creates a vector from 1 to 4 in steps of 1\n\nrep_vector1 &lt;- rep(1, times=4)         # repeats the value 1 4 times\nrep_vector2 &lt;- rep(d, times=4)         # repeats the vector d 4 times\nrep_vector3 &lt;- rep(d, each=4)          # repeats each value in d 4 times\nWe can also access individual values from each vector using single square brackets.\n# Define vector\nseq_vector1 &lt;- seq(1,4, by=0.5)\n\nseq_vector1[2]  # Output: \"1.5\"\nseq_vector1[3]  # Output: \"2\"\nWe can perform arithmetic operations with two numeric vectors in R, such as a + b, the operation is applied component-wise. This means each element in vector d is added to the corresponding element in vector e. If the vectors are of unequal length, R recycles elements of the shorter vector until it matches the length of the longer vector, with a warning if the lengths are not multiples of each other.\na &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nb &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\na + b  # Output: c(5, 7, 9) (1+4, 2+5, 3+6)\nWhen working with vectors of strings, the paste() function in R is a versatile tool. It is primarily used to concatenate elements of one or more vectors into strings, offering flexibility to combine text data either component-wise or by collapsing all elements into a single string. This makes paste() particularly useful for tasks such as creating descriptive labels, formatting output, or preparing data for presentation.\nKey Arguments:\n\nsep: Specifies the separator to place between concatenated elements. Default is a single space (\" \").\ncollapse: Combines all elements of a single vector into one string, using the specified delimiter. If not provided, each concatenated result remains as a separate string.\n\nWhen you have two or more vectors and want to combine corresponding elements (component-wise concatenation):\n# Example vectors\nproducts &lt;- c(\"Laptop\", \"Tablet\", \"Smartphone\")\nprices &lt;- c(\"1000\", \"500\", \"750\")\n\n# Combine product names and prices\nresult &lt;- paste(products, prices, sep=\" - $\")\nprint(result)  # Output: \"Laptop - $1000\" \"Tablet - $500\" \"Smartphone - $750\"\nWhen you want to combine all elements of a single vector into one string:\n# Example vector\nitems &lt;- c(\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\")\n\n# Collapse all items into a single string\nresult &lt;- paste(items, collapse=\", \")\nprint(result)  # Output: \"Apple, Banana, Cherry\""

They are ideal for mathematical computations, linear algebra operations, and organizing data with fixed dimensions. Matrices are created using the matrix() function, where you specify the data, number of rows (nrow), and columns (ncol). Operations like addition, subtraction, or multiplication can be applied element-wise or across rows and columns, and advanced matrix-specific operations (e.g., transposition, matrix multiplication) are supported.

Lists are created using the list() function, where each element can be named for easy reference. They are particularly useful in business analytics for grouping data with varied structures, such as customer demographics, sales figures, and statistical results. Accessing elements in a list is done using $ (by name) or double square brackets [[ ]] (by index).
