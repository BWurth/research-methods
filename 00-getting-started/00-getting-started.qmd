## What is R?

R is a powerful, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualisation. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and more. 

## Brief History of R

R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team. The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000. R is named partly after its creators (shared first letter of the authors, Ross and Robert) and partly as a play on the name of the S language, which it was designed to emulate. While S was a commercial software, R was created as a free alternative, gaining wide adoption due to its open-source nature and flexibility.

# Best Practices for Getting Started

## Setting up a working directory

Setting up a proper working directory is crucial for organizing your R projects:

1.  Use RStudio's project feature:
    -   Go to File \> New Project
    -   Choose a new or existing directory
    -   This creates an .Rproj file and sets the working directory automatically
2.  Alternatively, set the working directory manually:
    -   Use `setwd("/path/to/your/directory")` in your R script
    -   Or use Session \> Set Working Directory \> Choose Directory in RStudio

## How to organize project files for research

A well-organized project structure might look like this:

```         
project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── scripts/
├── output/
│   ├── figures/
│   └── tables/
├── docs/
└── project.Rproj
```

-   `data/`: Store your data files
-   `scripts/`: Keep your R scripts
-   `output/`: Save generated figures and tables
-   `docs/`: Store documentation and reports

## Importance of commenting and code organization

Good coding practices improve readability and reproducibility:

1.  Use clear and concise comments to explain your code
2.  Organize your code into logical sections
3.  Use meaningful variable and function names
4.  Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Example of well-commented code:

``` r
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read in the data
data <- read_csv("data/raw/survey_results.csv")

# Clean the data
clean_data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(age)) %>%  # Remove rows with missing age
  mutate(income = as.numeric(income))  # Convert income to numeric

# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stats <- clean_data %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_income = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_age = median(age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Print results
print(summary_stats)
```

## Version control basics

Version control is essential for tracking changes in your code and collaborating with others. Git is a popular version control system, and GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories.

Basic Git concepts:

-   Repository: A project's folder containing all files and version history 
-   Commit: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time 
-   Branch: A parallel version of your repository 
-   Pull request: A method to propose changes to a repository

While we won't go into detail here, learning Git can greatly enhance your research workflow.
